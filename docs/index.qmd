Hey there! I'm Maharrem, a grad student in Linguistics PhD program at the University of California, Davis. I study and research on sign languages, psycholinguistics of sign language, and related fields. In addition, I'm interested in language evolution. I also work as a project manager at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics.
